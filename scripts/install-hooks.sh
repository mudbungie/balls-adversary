# Install the balls pre-commit hook into this repository's shared
# hooks dir. Works from any linked worktree and from a bare hub.
#
# The hook is a small stub, not a symlink to a fixed checkout. An
# earlier version pointed the symlink at <git-common-dir>/../scripts,
# i.e. the scripts/ dir of a presumed main checkout beside .git. A
# bare hub has no main checkout — scripts/ lives only inside the
# ephemeral .balls-worktrees/<id>/ worktrees — so that symlink
# dangled permanently and git silently ran no hook at all.
#
# The stub instead resolves the *committing* worktree at commit time
# and execs that worktree's own scripts/pre-commit. Correct for bare
# hubs and ordinary clones alike; a removed worktree never dangles it.
